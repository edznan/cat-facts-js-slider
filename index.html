                    Unlike humans, cats cannot detect sweetness–which likely 
                    explains why they are not drawn to it at all.

                    A cat has the power to sometimes heal themselves by purring. 
                    A domestic cat’s purr has a frequency of between 25 and 150 Hertz, 
                    which happens to be the frequency at which muscles and bones best 
                    grow and repair themselves.

                    Despite imagery of cats happily drinking milk from saucers, studies 
                    indicate that cats are actually lactose intolerant and should avoid it entirely.

                    Cats only use their meows to talk to humans, not each other. 
                    The only time they meow to communicate with other felines is when 
                    they are kittens to signal to their mother.

                    A cat’s cerebral cortex contains about twice as many neurons as that of dogs. 
                    Cats have 300 million neurons, whereas dogs have about 160 million.

                    Polydactyl cats (a cat with 1-2 extra toes on their paws) have this as a result 
                    of a genetic mutation. These cats are also referred to as “Hemingway cats” because 
                    writer Ernest Hemingway reportedly owned dozens of them at his home in 
                    Key West, Florida.

                    Sir Isaac Newton is credited with creating the concept for the pet door that 
                    many cats use today to travel outdoors.

                    A cat’s smell is their strongest sense, and they rely on this leading sense to 
                    identify people and objects; a feline’s sense of smell is 14x better than a human’s.

                    Many authentic narrations say that the prophet Muhammad (pbuh) 
                    loved cats a lot and used to play with them occasionally.

                    A cat only has the ability to move their jaw up and down,

                    Your cat’s heart beats at a rate almost double that of yours,
